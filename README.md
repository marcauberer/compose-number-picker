Compose Number Picker is a library, which provides a simple to use, lightweight number picker component for Jetpack Compose. It has support for horizontal and vertical orientation.

## Try it
If you want to test the library, please visit the sample app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chillibits.composenumberpickersample)!

## Usage
If you haven't Jetpack Compose ready to go in your project, please refer to [this guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup) to include Jetpack Compose into your project.

Then include ComposeNumberPicker to your project:
```groovy
implementation 'com.chillibits:composenumberpicker:1.1.2'
```

As Compose Number Picker supports horizontal and vertical orientation, it provides two components for use:
-   HorizontalNumberPicker [view component](./numberpicker/src/main/java/com/chillibits/composenumberpicker/HorizontalNumberPicker.kt)
-   VerticalNumberPicker [view component](./numberpicker/src/main/java/com/chillibits/composenumberpicker/VerticalNumberPicker.kt)

This is like a `HorizontalNumberPicker` would look like in your Compose layout:
```kotlin
HorizontalNumberPicker(
    min = 10,
    max = 100,
    default = 50,
    modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp),
	onValueChange = { value ->
		Toast.makeText(this@MainActivity, value.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
	}
)
```
If you need an example, please look into the [code](./app/src/main/java/com/chillibits/composenumberpickersample/MainActivity.kt#L35) of the demo app.

## Supported languages
